This work is part of the research effort towards the publication of the paper

Mehmetoglu, Mustafa, Emrah Akyol, and Kenneth Rose. "Deterministic Annealing Optimization for Witsenhausen's and Related Decentralized Stochastic Control Problems." arXiv preprint arXiv:1607.02893 (2016). (https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02893)

In this work we optimize the controllers using the basic gradient descent approach (not the more advanced DA approach as presented in the paper). The implementation uses GPUs via the CUDA framework.
